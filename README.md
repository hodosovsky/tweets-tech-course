# tweets-tech-course

The test task is completed according to the terms of reference. Routing of two
pages: Home and Tweets is implemented. On Home page after clicking the [TWEET]
link a user is redirected to the Tweets page. On Tweets page after clicking the
[GO BACK] link a user is redirected to the Home page. The Tweets page displays
user cards with data concerning the amount of tweets and followers. After
clicking the [Follow] button, the number of followers increases by 1, when you
click it again, it decreases by 1. Also, button styles change after clicking.
Pagination is implemented - displays 6 cards on request. When you click the
[Load more] button, the next 6 cards will be loaded. Filtering of user cards by
category Follow is implemented. Clicking the dropdawn leads to the list
appearance to select the category for displaying cards: All, Follow, Following.
The project is deployed on GitHub Pages.
